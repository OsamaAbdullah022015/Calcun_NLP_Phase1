Message from Mayor Leslie Hager-Smith 
Blacksburg is proud to be counted among the hundreds of local 
governments across America that are taking action to address climate 
change, while making their communities healthier and more resilient. We 
have long recognized our fundamental responsibility to take stock of our 
share of the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions and hold up our end of the 
bargain to ensure a stable climate for future generations.  One key way we 
are doing that is by integrating goals from Blacksburg’s 2016 Climate Action 
Plan into its Comprehensive Plan, which will elevate climate priorities into 
future land-use, infrastructure, and transportation decision. 
 
We also know that reducing emissions, while critically important, will not be 
enough.  As a global community, we have been burning fossil fuels at an 
ever-accelerating pace since the advent of the industrial revolution.  Those emissions are already in our 
atmosphere and we will have to contend with a certain amount of climate change that is already baked in.   
 
Stressors like poverty, inequality, public health challenges, economic volatility, and environmental 
degradation will almost certainly be made worse by a changing climate. These changes have the potential 
to disrupt our lives and livelihoods in numerous ways, and we know we will need to adapt.  For Blacksburg 
to do that, we need to first assess which community systems might be at risk.  We also recognize that the 
needs of people who are likely to be hurt first and worst by climate change should be prioritized in our 
future plans for climate adaptation. 
 
To become a truly climate-resilient community, Blacksburg has to do three things: continue to act boldly to 
reduce our greenhouse gas emissions; begin adapting to changes that cannot be avoided under a low-
emissions scenario; and, pro-actively plan for how we might respond to the challenges of a high-emissions 
scenario.    The good news is, climate mitigation and adaptation strategies can work in concert, providing 
benefits that align with community goals around affordable housing, resilient natural systems, expanded 
transportation options, and thriving civic spaces. 
 
As I reflect on the ways in which Blacksburg has come together so many times in the past to overcome 
daunting challenges, I know we are equal to the task ahead of us.   
Leslie Hager-Smith 
Mayor of Blacksburg, VA

Centering Equity 
 
 
 
 
 
Centering Equity in Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Planning & Implementation 
Climate change does not affect everyone equally.  In evaluating potential impacts a key consideration is 
to recognize that some people will be disproportionately worse off than others. These groups are 
commonly referred to as “vulnerable populations” or “marginalized groups.”  For the purposes of this 
report, they will be identified as frontline communities, because it is they who will be on the 
front lines of the unfolding climate emergency.  Factors that increase the potential impact of climate 
hazards on individuals include: 
 
 Age factors (very young and very old people are more vulnerable to heat stress) 
 Complex health challenges  -or- mobility, sensory or cognitive impairments 
 Limited social connections or support networks 
 Limited financial resources 
 Working outdoors or in unconditioned spaces 
 Inadequate, unstable or unaffordable housing options 
 Insecure or unaffordable transportation options 
 Language or cultural barriers 
 
With the exception of age, the factors listed above are disproportionately found among people of color, 
indigenous peoples, immigrant communities, and in rural areas.  The following excerpt from “Making 
Equity Real in Climate Adaptation and Community Resilience Guidebook”, emphasizes the historical 
context and clear need to place equity at the center of climate adaptation work: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To make equity real in its climate adaptation and resilience work, the Town of Blacksburg commits to: 
1. Embedding equity in the mission, vision and values for Blacksburg’s adaptation and resilience plan. 
2. Building equity and deep engagement into the planning and implementation process. 
3. Ensuring equity outcomes by responding to community needs in policy-making and implementation. 
4. Measuring and analyzing for equity outcomes over time with an eye toward continual improvement. 
 
“Decades of underinvestment and unjust systems have left frontline communities 
with high levels of poverty and pollution, poorer health outcomes, a lack of quality 
jobs and education opportunities, outdated and weak critical infrastructure, 
disproportionately high costs for energy, transportation and basic necessities, and 
limited access to public services. Moreover, frontline communities have long been 
excluded from policy and funding decision-making processes that can be used to 
address the injustices they experience and support a transition to healthy 
communities. Exclusion from the decision-making table is one reason the needs of 
frontline communities have not been prioritized. As a result of these injustices, 
frontline communities have fewer resources to deal with the risks from climate 
change. These communities are often hit first and worst by climate impacts, which 
only exacerbate the environmental and socioeconomic inequities they already face.”

Introduction, Background & Process 
How hot is too hot and when does it become a problem?  
How wet is too wet and when does it become a problem? 
How do these and other changes to the climate intersect? 
How should localities like Blacksburg plan and adapt? 
 
The answers to these questions are challenging to navigate.  We can explore the question through some 
comparative examples.  Take for instance, a midsummer day in Anchorage, Alaska where a temperature 
above 80oF would be considered extremely hot, since the average daily highs in July are usually in the mid to 
high 60s.  Yet this same temperature would be considered unseasonably cool for Phoenix, Arizona, where 
July average daily highs topping 105oF are the norm.  In these two places, as in all places, both the natural 
systems and the built environment have emerged, were cultivated, or were constructed to accommodate a 
predictable range of climatic conditions.    
 
Blacksburg falls between these two extremes, with an average high temperature in July in the low to mid 
80s.  Occasional hotter days are not unheard of in our region.  The historic record shows that between 1950 
and 2013, Blacksburg had around 4-5 days per year where the temperatures got above 90oF, with far fewer 
days that topped 95oF. (source: NOAA Climate Explorer, Blacksburg, VA in Montgomery County—Days with 
max >90oF, >95oF, Historical Observed).  
 
Communities are built over a long time.  Buildings and infrastructure are constructed to perform within a 
predictable range of conditions and are expected to be around for many decades, if not centuries. Similarly, 
natural systems, which contribute diverse and incalculable value to the surrounding community, are highly 
tied to a predictable set of climatic conditions for that region.   Whole economies like agriculture and 
tourism revolve around predictability of the seasons. All of these systems become vulnerable and potentially 
unstable if climatic conditions change substantially.  
 
Communities like Blacksburg will be well served by taking an honest look at the climate vulnerabilities they 
will be facing in the coming years and decades.  Decisions we make now around infrastructure, land use, 
transportation investments, buildings, and public health can prepare us, not just to survive in a changing 
climate, but to thrive. 
6 
Introduction, Background & Process 
Climate Action: Mitigation and Adaptation 
Climate Change will be the defining challenge of the 21st century. Evidence continues to mount that 
continued inaction on greenhouse gas emissions could lead to catastrophic changes, destabilizing the very 
systems that support and sustain human civilizations.  Billions of people will experience these changes 
through threats to public health, disruption of national and local economies, and food and water insecurity.  
Buildings and infrastructure will be increasingly impacted by the severity and frequency of weather events.  
For certain coastal communities, these threats will be amplified by rising sea levels. 
 
A business-as-usual pattern of carbon emissions is likely to create 4°C of warming, and could lock in enough 
sea level rise to submerge land currently home to 470 to 760 million people, with unstoppable rise unfolding 
over centuries. By contrast, significant cuts to global carbon emissions limiting warming to 2°C could bring 
the number as low as 130 million people.  Foreign policy experts increasingly warn that people internally 
displaced from sea level rise, droughts, wildfires, food insecurity, and super storms are considered a risk to 
domestic stability within their own countries and international security more broadly.   
 
While a worldwide policy response to climate change is urgently required, a great deal of the action and 
implementation will have to take place at the local level.  Back 
in 2007, Blacksburg was proud to join a growing list of U.S. 
cities that stepped forward to make a formal commitment to 
reduce their community’s greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, 
Blacksburg took a major step toward operationalizing that 
commitment by adopting a Climate Action Plan.  
 
Blacksburg’s Climate Action Plan (CAP) is solely focused on 
mitigation, and establishes a set of strategies that will enable 
Blacksburg to significantly reduce community-wide 
greenhouse gas emissions.  While recognizing the seriousness 
of the climate crisis, the CAP does not attempt to evaluate 
how Blacksburg might be specifically vulnerable in a 
changing climate, or what we, as a community can do to 
prepare and adapt.  Mitigation and adaptation measures are 
both clearly needed if we intend transition to a thriving, 
resilient future. 
In the pages that follow, this Climate Vulnerability Assessment 
will demonstrate these area of heightened vulnerability for Blacksburg and will point toward a set of 
objectives for how Blacksburg can adapt. 
7 
Introduction, Background & Process 
Planning for the Unavoidable...and More 
Climate change is already here.  We can see the evidence in temperature records being broken year after 
year along with other accelerating indicators like sea level rise, melting glaciers, and more frequent and 
intense storms.  Blacksburg has committed to doing its part to reduce its share of greenhouse gas emissions.  
At the same time, we also recognize that there is a certain amount of climate change that is unavoidable, 
even under a best-case scenario.  Even if we are successful, not just locally, but as a global community in 
sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, there is a certain amount of climate 
change that is simply “baked in” at this point.  At a minimum, all communities should start planning now for 
how they will address the changes that are anticipated under this best case/low-emissions scenario.  Despite 
near unanimity among climate scientists that this is a problem requiring urgent, bold, and coordinated 
action, it is increasingly unclear if the needed political leadership will emerge on the national and world 
stages to put us on a path to that lower-emission scenario.  Therefore, common sense dictates that it would 
be wise to plan for higher-emissions scenarios as well.   
Climate Metrics Considered 
To evaluate the climate hazards Blacksburg may need to start planning for, thirteen key temperature and 
precipitation metrics were analyzed. Each of these metrics point to potential areas of vulnerability: to 
people, to natural systems, to the economy, and to infrastructure and basic services.   
 The climate metrics evaluated for this report include: 
 Cooling Degree Days (indicator of energy required to cool buildings in warmer months) 
 Growing Degree Days (indicator of agricultural production potential, as well as plant heat stress) 
 Modified Growing Degree Days (indicator of heat-related plant stress for key agricultural staple crops) 
 Heating Degree Days (indicator of energy required to heat buildings in cold months) 
 Days with Maximum Temperature > 90 degrees (hot days—risk of heat stress) 
 Days with Maximum Temperature > 95 degrees (very hot days—high risk of heat stress) 
 Days with Minimum Temperature < 32 degrees (cold days) 
 Days with Maximum Temperature < 32 degrees (very cold days) 
 Average Daily Minimum Temperature (overnight temperatures) 
 Total Annual Precipitation (indicator of changes to overall hydrological cycle) 
 Total Monthly Precipitation (indicator of changes in seasonal precipitation) 
 Days with > 1” precipitation (indicator of potential flooding events) 
 Dry Days, days with < .01” precipitation (indicator of drought or change of precipitation frequency) 
8 
Introduction, Background & Process 
Temporal, Emissions, and Geographic Scopes Evaluated 
While it might seem intuitive that only local changes to the climate would be relevant, changes at the national 
level may prove to be just as impactful.  At the local level, we can anticipate vulnerabilities for individuals, 
private property, natural systems, and infrastructure.  At the national level, we may see complex, 
interdependent systems like the electric grid or networks of food production stressed, possibly to the 
breaking point.  Extreme changes to the climate may even make some parts of the country less livable to its 
residents prompting populations to voluntarily displace.   
With an eye toward development of an adaptation and resiliency plan, it is also useful to explore different 
time scales.  For some adaptation strategies, a shorter time horizon is most appropriate (e.g. a public 
engagement campaign on mitigating heat stress for outdoor workers).  For others, particularly those that 
involve investments in infrastructure or buildings, a focus on climate realities nearer the end of this century 
are more salient.  
For these reasons, mid-century and end-of-century time scales, low- and high- emissions scenarios, and local 
and national geographic scopes were evaluated for each of the thirteen climate metrics under consideration 
in order to identify and prioritize the top climate hazards of concern for Blacksburg.

Introduction, Background & Process 
Community Systems at Risk 
Changes to the climate are expected to impact most aspects of our lives and livelihoods.  Significant shifts in 
precipitation patterns and seasonal temperatures within and even beyond Blacksburg’s borders have the 
potential to result in an array of local impacts that we can and should begin planning for today.  However, in 
order to determine where the Town should focus its efforts, the critical community systems that may be at 
risk should first be identified.  The table below organizes these community systems into four broad 
categories: people & community, natural systems, economy & employment, and infrastructure & basic 
services. Elements and systems that are critical to the functioning of our community and the well being of 
residents are listed below each heading. 
Identifying Top Climate Hazards 
Evaluating each climate metric in this way indicates the primary climate hazards of concern for Blacksburg: 
 hotter summers (Blacksburg and U.S.) 
 warmer winters (Blacksburg and U.S.) 
 increased precipitation (Blacksburg) & changing precipitation patterns (U.S.) 
Now that we have a sense of the degree of change (frequency, intensity) of each of the key climate metrics, 
we can turn our attention to what that might mean for Blacksburg.  Specifically, what community systems 
might be most impacted?

Introduction, Background & Process 
Prioritizing Risks 
To be sure, not all community systems are created equal, nor will they be equally impacted by hotter 
summers, warmer winters, and changing precipitation patterns.  For each of the thirteen climate metrics the 
following questions were used to evaluate the relative vulnerability of each community system: 
 
What is the potential impact of a given climate metric on this community system? (low to high) 
 Probability, frequency, and intensity of change 
 Community systems that could be adversely impacted 
 Types and degree of anticipated impact on each community system 
 Geographic scope of impact (narrow to broad) 
 Demographic scope + equity lens: likelihood of disproportionate impacts on frontline communities 
How much adaptive capacity exists to mitigate these anticipated impacts? (high to low) 
 Practical or technological feasibility of adaptation measures 
 Degree of local control to enact adaptation measures 
 Available resources to pursue adaptation measures 
Within each chapter, a critical community systems table and risk prioritization matrix 
offer a snapshot of the community systems most at risk from each climate hazard.  The Critical Community 
Systems Table is broken up into four groupings: People & Community, Natural Systems, Economy & 
Employment, and Infrastructure & Basic Services.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note that the letters A-W in both the table and matrix correspond with one another.  For both, the darker 
squares indicate the community systems that may be the most vulnerable in a changing climate.  It is these 
areas of heightened potential vulnerability that will warrant special attention and focus for climate 
adaptation policy-making.

HOTTER SUMMERS 
13 
Hazard: Hotter Summers in Blacksburg 
In Blacksburg, the average temperature in July is usually in the low to mid 80s, but hotter days are not 
unheard of in our region.  Between 1950 and 2013, the historic record shows that Blacksburg had 
around 4-5 days per year where the temperatures got above 90oF, with far fewer days that topped 95oF.  
Looking ahead, the weighted mean of climate models indicate that summer highs will be increasing in 
our area.  By 2050, we are likely to see more than a six-fold increase in the number of days that top 90oF 
even under a low-emissions scenario.  This is the amount of climate change that appears unavoidable 
based on greenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere.  We can expect even more high-heat 
days under a higher emissions scenario by midcentury.  Nearer to the end of this century, a much 
sharper divergence in the number of very hot days is anticipated under the low– and high-
emissions scenarios.  (sources: NOAA Climate Explorer, Blacksburg, VA in Montgomery 
County—Days with max >90oF, >95oF, Historical Observed, Projected Modeled Data;  
Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States: Fourth National Climate Assessment,

*30 year averages around each target year for low– and high-emissions scenarios; 2035-2065 and 2065-2095, respectively 
Outdoor workers and people who 
lack air conditioning may experience 
extreme discomfort or heat illness 
on hot days, especially if humidity is 
high and wind is light. Hot days also 
stress plants, animals, and 
infrastructure such as electric lines, 
roads, and rails. Increased demand 
for electricity to cool homes and 
businesses also stresses energy 
infrastructure on hot days. 
Frontline Communities & Hotter Summers 
 
Age factors (very young and very old) 
 
Complex health challenges 
 
Mobility, sensory or cognitive impairments 
 
Limited social connection or support networks 
 
Limited financial resources 
 
Working outdoors or in unconditioned spaces 
 
Inadequate, unstable or unaffordable housing 
 
Insecure or unaffordable transportation 
 
Language or cultural barriers 
Frontline communities are likely to be disproportionately 
impacted by hotter summers.  For instance, if someone is 
suffering from asthma that is exacerbated by an extended 
heat wave, and they don’t have health insurance...how 
would they get the medical help they need? As we 
evaluate the range of possible adaptation strategies to 
hotter summers in Blacksburg, frontline communities 
should be at the decision-making table to guide the 
process of identifying and developing the policies and 
programs that will best align with their needs.   
14 
Hazard: Hotter Summers across the United States 
Increasing heat beyond Blacksburg’s borders also has the potential to create local impacts.  The maps below 
compare different scenarios for # of days with a maximum temperature above 90oF.  The top map shows the 
historical average, while the middle and bottom maps show the anticipated # of high-heat days across the 
continental United States by midcentury under low–emissions and end of century under a high-emissions 
scenarios, respectively. While an overall warming trend is indicated, note that greater relative warming that is 
expected for the South and Midwest.  What might this mean for agricultural productivity and overall food security?  
Or for population migration due to water scarcity or wildfire risk?  Or the range of certain disease-vector insects? 
In addition to the local heat-related hazards identified on the previous page, increasing summer heat at the 
national scale has the potential to create local impacts that should also be considered as we evaluate Blacksburg’s 
vulnerabilities to climate change.

Climate Metrics: Hotter Summers in Blacksburg & the U.S. 
Hotter Summers: Key Climate Metrics & Findings  
Of the thirteen climate metrics evaluated, these six point to an array of potential vulnerabilities for Blacksburg. 
Cooling Degree Days  (CDDs) 
 The number of cooling degree days reflects the amount of energy typically used to cool a 
building when it is warm outside. At the household level, increasing cooling degree days will 
disproportionately impact low-income households, and people without air-conditioning or 
who live in older less energy-efficient homes.  At the regional and national level, increasing 
cooling degree days points to the potential for energy infrastructure to become stressed 
beyond its capacity. 
 
Modified Growing Degree Days  
 Corn growers use the number of modified growing degree days to monitor the development of 
corn crops.  As corn development occurs only when temperature is above 50°F but below 86°F, 
the standard calculation for growing-degree days is modified to omit conditions outside this 
range. In future decades, regions where temperatures regularly exceed 86°F may be less 
successful in growing corn and potentially other staple crops that form the backbone of our 
food system. 
 
Days with Max Temp > 90 degrees and Days w/Max Temp  > 95 degrees (hot and very hot days) 
 Outdoor workers and people who lack air conditioning may experience extreme discomfort or 
heat illness on hot days, especially if humidity is high and wind is light. Hot days also stress 
plants, animals, and infrastructure such as electric lines, roads, and rails. A significant 
anticipated increase in hot and very hot days will lead to higher and more frequent peak 
demand for electric power, further stressing the electricity grid and increasing the risk of 
power interruptions. 
 
Average Daily Minimum Temperature and Days with Minimum Temperature > 80 degrees 
 A day’s lowest (minimum) temperature usually occurs in the early morning, just before 
sunrise. Averaging the daily low temperatures for any period results in a mean minimum 
temperature for that period.  These daily periods of low temperature give plants, animals, and 
people a chance to recover from daytime heat. When daily minimum temperatures aren’t 
sufficiently cool, plant and animal responses can trigger ecosystem changes.  The # of warm 
nights associated with rising average daily minimum temperatures, especially # of days with 
minimum temperature above 80 degrees can also increase the demand for energy in a 24-hour 
period and can stress energy infrastructure.

Prioritized Areas of Risk: Hotter Summers 
Prioritized Areas of Risk 
To identify areas of heightened potential vulnerability, climate metrics for hotter summers were evaluated 
relative to critical community systems for Blacksburg.  In addition to evaluating the direction of anticipated 
change for these climate metrics, the following factors were explored to evaluate overall risk: 
 
What is the potential impact of hotter summers on our critical community system? (low to high) 
 Probability, frequency, and intensity of change 
 Community systems that could be impacted 
 Types and degree of anticipated impact on each community system 
 Geographic scope of impact (narrow to broad) 
 Demographic scope + equity lens: likelihood of disproportionate impacts on frontline communities 
How much adaptive capacity exists to mitigate these anticipated impacts? (high to low) 
 Practical or technological feasibility of adaptation measures 
 Degree of local control to enact adaptation measures 
 Available resources to effectively pursue adaptation measures 
The community systems table and risk prioritization matrix on the following page offer a 
snapshot of the community systems most at risk from hotter summers.  At a glance, it is apparent that 
hotter summers have the potential to disrupt most of our community’s critical systems to some degree.  
Note that the letters A-W in the risk matrix correspond to the community systems listed in the community 
systems table above it.  The darker squares indicate the systems that may be the most vulnerable to 
increasing heat in our community.  It is these areas of heightened potential vulnerability that will warrant 
special attention and focus for climate adaptation policy-making. 
 
To be sure, the task before us is daunting.  For some of the community systems most at risk (ecosystem 
services), the scale of the challenge and our capacity to implement effective adaptation strategies seem 
quite limited.  For others, (public health) a path forward to address heat stress and heat illness for 
vulnerable segments of the population may be more straightforward. 
 
The following pages list out some recommended adaptation paths for community systems most at risk 
from hotter summers.  Translating these recommendations into actionable policies and programs will 
require further collaboration with frontline communities, decision-makers and other stakeholders to 
ensure the resulting adaptation and resilience strategies are realistic, effective, and equitable.

WARMER WINTERS 
21 
Hazard: Warmer Winters in Blacksburg 
Winters in Blacksburg tend to be relatively mild. Traditionally, we have around a dozen deep freeze 
days per year, during which the temperature never gets above 32 degrees F.  Although these days can 
be pretty miserable for humans, they are very important for the health of farms and forests.  Gypsy 
moths, hemlock woolly adelgids, emerald ash borers, corn 
rootworm, southern pine beetles, and marmorated stink bugs 
are all susceptible to very cold temperatures.  With fewer deep 
freeze events, populations of these pest insects may flourish and 
do major damage to our local forests and farms.  By 2050, we 
are likely to see the number of very cold days cut in half under 
both  the low-emissions and high-emissions scenarios.  This 
amount of climate change appears unavoidable based on the 
amount of greenhouse gas emissions already in the 
atmosphere.  Nearer to the end of this century, there is 
greater anticipated divergence between the low– and high-
emissions scenarios, and the number of very cold days 
could fall to less than a third of the historic average.  In 
addition to a reduction in the number of very cold days 
and deep freeze events, average daily temperatures in 
the winter months are expected to rise.  This may bring 
about an additional agricultural challenge due to a 
reduction in “chill hours”, periods when the 
temperature hovers just above freezing.  Many fruit-
bearing trees require a certain number of chill hours in 
order to produce fruit the following year.

At the local geographic scale, warmer winters may not 
seem to pose much of a disproportionate risk to frontline 
communities, in fact, there is likely to be reduced energy 
cost burden in the winter months, a challenge for many 
low-income households.  At a national geographic scale, 
however, warmer winters are anticipated to be very 
disruptive to ecological cycles and agricultural 
productivity.  Warmer winters may also extend the range 
of disease-carrying insects farther north.   As a result, 
vector-borne diseases and food insecurity may both rise.

Hazard: Warmer Winters in the United States 
In addition to concerns about the affect of warmer winters on farms and forests there are also public health 
implications to consider, namely that warmer winters across much of the U.S. are likely to expand the territory 
of human disease vector insects carrying tropical illnesses like malaria, yellow fever, Zika, dengue, and Chagas 
disease.  Of these tropical diseases, dengue is probably the most concerning for Blacksburg and the 
surrounding region, as the northernmost bound of this virus is just to the south of us and may reach our area 
by 2085.  For tick– and mosquito-borne diseases that are already here such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain 
Spotted Fever, and West Nile Virus, warmer winters will likely increase the number of ticks and mosquitoes 
that are able to survive the winter and expand the number of months per year when they are active.

Climate Metrics: Warmer Winters in Blacksburg & the U.S. 
Warmer Winters: Key Climate Metrics & Findings 
Of the thirteen climate metrics evaluated, these three point to a mix of vulnerabilities and other outcomes 
for Blacksburg.   
 
Heating Degree Days (HDDs) 
 The number of heating degree days at any location reflects the amount of energy people use to 
heat a building when it is cool outside. Lower numbers of heating degree days indicate lower 
demand for energy.  Heating degree days measure how much (in degrees), and for how long (in 
days), outside air temperature is below 65°F. Engineers and utility companies use a location’s 
annual number of heating degree days as one input when estimating demand for energy in the 
cold season.  
 
Days with Minimum Temperature < 32 degrees (cold days) 
 The total number of days per year when the temperature dips below 32°F (0°C) is an indicator 
of how often cold days occur.  A decrease in the number of days temperature drops below 
freezing promotes earlier spring snowmelt and runoff, with important consequences for 
managing water resources. Below-freezing temperatures can cause driving hazards, aircraft 
icing, and damage to infrastructure, yet ski resorts and other winter recreation businesses 
depend on sufficiently cold days to maintain snowpack. Some plants require a cumulative 
number of days below freezing before they can begin budding or blooming in the spring.  
 
 
Days with Maximum Temperature < 32 degrees (very cold days) 
 The total number of days per year when the highest temperature is less than 32°F (0°C) is an 
indicator of how often very cold days occur.  Days when the highest temperature doesn’t rise 
above the freezing point of water are called “icing days.” The annual number of icing days tells 
us how much rest plants get from growing. With too few icing days, some plants do not 
perceive a “reset” signal to begin budding or blooming in the spring. The annual number of 
icing days can also help predict how populations of pest and disease-vector insects will grow or 
shrink in response to changing seasonal patterns.

Prioritized Areas of Risk 
To identify areas of heightened potential vulnerability, climate metrics for warmer winters were evaluated 
relative to critical community systems for Blacksburg.  In addition to evaluating the direction of anticipated 
change for these climate metrics, the following factors were explored to evaluate overall risk: 
 
What is the potential impact of warmer winters on our critical community systems? (low to high) 
 Probability, frequency, and intensity of change 
 Community systems that could be impacted 
 Types and degree of anticipated impact on each community system 
 Geographic scope of impact (narrow to broad) 
 Demographic scope + equity lens: likelihood of disproportionate impacts on frontline communities 
How much adaptive capacity exists to mitigate these anticipated impacts? (high to low) 
 Practical or technological feasibility of adaptation measures 
 Degree of local control to enact adaptation measures 
 Available resources to effectively pursue adaptation measures 
 Available resources to effectively pursue adaptation measures 
The community systems table and risk prioritization matrix on the following page offer a 
snapshot of the community systems most at risk from warmer winters.  At a glance, it is apparent that 
warmer winters have the greatest potential to disrupt our natural systems with additional worrying 
impacts to food security and human health.  Note that the letters A-W in the risk matrix correspond to the 
community systems listed in the community systems table above it.  The darker squares indicate the 
systems that may be the most vulnerable to warmer winters in our community and beyond.  It is these 
areas of heightened potential vulnerability that will warrant special attention and focus for climate 
adaptation policy-making. 
 
As with hotter summers, warmer winters’ potential to affect agricultural productivity at the national and 
international scale is worrying.  Similarly, northward spread of disease vector insects, invasive species, and 
agricultural pests is likely.  Local forestlands, with tree species that are accustomed to a certain climatic 
range may become stressed.  All of these risks are very challenging to adapt to at the local level.  
 
The following pages list out some recommended adaptation paths for community systems most at risk 
from warmer winters.  Translating these recommendations into actionable policies and programs will 
require further collaboration with frontline communities, decision-makers, and other stakeholders to 
ensure the resulting adaptation and resilience strategies are realistic, effective, and equitable.

CHANGING PRECIPITATION PATTERNS 
29 
Hazard: Increased Precipitation in Blacksburg 
Blacksburg typically gets between 38-39” of rain per year.  While many parts of the country are anticipated to 
experience reduced precipitation and even severe drought conditions due to climate change, it appears that 
precipitation will be increasing in Blacksburg, particularly in the winter 
months.  Climate modeling also indicates that we are likely to have a 
modest increase in the annual number of heavy rain events.  Under 
both the low– and high-emissions scenarios by mid-century, these 
changes are likely to be nearly imperceptible. Under a high-emission 
scenario, however, we may see as much as a 31% increase in 
heavy rainfall events by the end of the century. Heavy 
rainfall events always have the potential to create 
flooding risks, putting people in harms way, and 
increasing the likelihood of costly damage to 
buildings and infrastructure.   
 
While more overall precipitation is anticipated for 
the region, we are also (paradoxically) anticipated to 
have a slight increase in the number of dry days.  
Longer dry periods between rains, particularly 
heavier ones, can actually raise the risk of 
destructive flooding and even forest fires.  Overall, 
there is a lot of uncertainty about how local 
ecosystems and the built environment could be 
impacted by changing precipitation patterns.

At the local geographic scale, total precipitation is 
anticipated to increase which may pose a 
disproportionate risk to frontline communities, who  
are statistically more likely to live in flood-prone areas.  
At a national geographic scale, widespread hydrological 
changes are anticipated.  Some areas will see a 
substantial increase in annual precipitation while 
others will encounter drier conditions.  Both are 
anticipated to be very disruptive to ecological cycles 
and agricultural productivity.  As a result, vector-borne 
diseases and food insecurity may both rise.

Areas of Vulnerability: Increased Precipitation in Blacksburg 
At the national scale, there is great variability in what the climate models are telling us about precipitation patterns.  
Some areas may experience extended, severe drought while others will see a great deal more precipitation.  These 
changes at the national scale have the potential to disrupt and destabilize food production, create widespread 
ecological disruption and loss of biodiversity, and could even contribute to population displacement due to repeated 
flooding, wildfires, and insufficient water supply.

Hazard: Changing Precipitation Patterns in the U.S. 
Changing Precipitation Patterns Key Climate Metrics & Findings 
Of the thirteen climate metrics evaluated, these three point to a mix of vulnerabilities and other outcomes 
for Blacksburg.   
 
Total Annual Precipitation (indicator of changes to local and national hydrological cycle) 
 
At the local level, total annual precipitation is anticipated to increase around 5-6% by midcentury 
under both the low– and high-emission scenarios.  Closer to the end of the century, there is more 
divergence between the low– and high-emissions scenarios, with an expected 7% and 10% average 
annual increase expected, respectively.  At the national level, some areas are expected to receive 
more precipitation while others will be getting drier.  All of these changes are anticipated to have 
wide ranging effects that could directly and indirectly impact Blacksburg.  
 
Total Monthly Precipitation (indicator of changes in seasonal precipitation) 
 
In Blacksburg, the largest increase in precipitation relative to the historic average is expected for 
winter months by end of century under a high-emission scenario (15%), followed by spring (12%), 
summer (7%), and fall (3%).  The unpredictability of the type of winter precipitation is a challenging 
factor to plan around.  Snow and ice can increase road hazards and contribute to widespread 
disruption to the community.  All types of increased precipitation have the potential to overwhelm 
stormwater infrastructure, particular in areas that are already at or near system capacity.  
 
Days with > 1” precipitation (indicator of potential flooding events) 
 
The number of days per year when locations receive more than 1 inch of precipitation is an indicator 
of how often very heavy precipitation events occur. This measurement may also be used as an 
indicator of flood risk.  Comparing the number of days with heavy precipitation at a single location 
over time can reveal a trend of increasing or decreasing flood risk.  
 
Dry Days, days with <.01” precipitation 
 
The number of dry days per year—days when precipitation is less than 0.01 inches—gives a sense of 
the portion of the year when no moisture is being added to the environment. Changes in the 
number of dry days can indicate a tendency toward drier or wetter conditions.  Paradoxically, while 
it appears that Blacksburg will see an increase in total precipitation, the # of dry days per year is also 
expected to increase slightly under a high emissions scenario, which may mean that we can expect 
precipitation events to become more intense.  Additionally, when the ground is drier, these higher 
intensity precipitation events can be more damaging, with a higher risk of flash floods, erosion, 
mudslides, and sedimentation of local waterways.  
Climate Metrics: Changing Precipitation Patterns in Blacksburg & the U.S. 
32 
Prioritized Areas of Risk 
To identify areas of heightened potential vulnerability, climate metrics for warmer winters were evaluated 
relative to critical community systems for Blacksburg.  In addition to evaluating the direction of anticipated 
change for these climate metrics, the following factors were explored to evaluate overall risk: 
 
What is the potential impact of changing precipitation patterns on our critical community 
systems? (low to high) 
 Probability, frequency, and intensity of change 
 Community systems that could be impacted 
 Types and degree of anticipated impact on each community system 
 Geographic scope of impact (narrow to broad) 
 Demographic scope + equity lens: likelihood of disproportionate impacts on frontline communities 
How much adaptive capacity exists to mitigate these anticipated impacts? (high to low) 
 Practical or technological feasibility of adaptation measures 
 Degree of local control to enact adaptation measures 
 Available resources to effectively pursue adaptation measures 
 Available resources to effectively pursue adaptation measures 
The community systems table and risk prioritization matrix on the following page offer a 
snapshot of the community systems most at risk from changing precipitation patterns.  At a glance, it is 
apparent that changing precipitation patterns have the greatest potential to disrupt our natural systems 
with additional worrying impacts to food security and an elevated risk to buildings, infrastructure, and 
public safety from flooding.  Note that the letters A-W in the risk matrix correspond to the community 
systems listed in the community systems table above it.  The darker squares indicate the systems that may 
be the most vulnerable to warmer winters in our community and beyond.  It is these areas of heightened 
potential vulnerability that will warrant special attention and focus for climate adaptation policy-making. 
 
As with hotter summers and warmer winters, changing precipitation patterns have the potential to affect 
agricultural productivity at the national and international scale.  Local biological communities and 
forestlands, with tree species that are accustomed to a certain range of hydrological conditions may 
become stressed.  All of these risks are very challenging to adapt to at the local level.  
 
The following pages list out some recommended adaptation paths for community systems most at risk 
from changing precipitation patterns.  Translating these recommendations into actionable policies and 
programs will require further collaboration with frontline communities, decision-makers, and other 
stakeholders to ensure the resulting adaptation and resilience strategies are realistic, effective, and 
equitable.

Next Steps 
Communities like Blacksburg will be well served by taking an honest look at the climate vulnerabilities they will be 
facing in the coming years and decades. Decisions we make now around infrastructure, land use, transportation 
investments, buildings, and public health can prepare us, not just to survive in a changing climate, but to thrive.  
Blacksburg's Climate Vulnerability Assessment has revealed a handful of community systems that are most at risk 
in a changing climate, as highlighted in the chart below: 
Going forward, the Town intends to convene expert and equity-centered policy development teams to 
investigate our best strategy options for adaptation and future resilience.  The four policy teams will focus on the 
following themes: Food Resiliency & Security, Human Health & Wellbeing, Biodiversity & Ecosystems, and 
Infrastructure and Basic Services. 
The public is invited to share their ideas and priorities and submit questions as we investigate the range of 
potential adaptation strategies.

Next Steps 
Feedback and Engagement Process 
This report was developed to identify and prioritize the climate hazards that Blacksburg will be facing in the 
coming decades, the community systems that may be most at risk, and to put forth a set of broad policy 
recommendations to be considered.  Translating those recommendations into actionable policies and programs 
will require collaborative and creative partnerships with the whole community.   
 
If you have questions or feedback for the Climate Vulnerability Assessment Advisory Team or the Town, you can 
provide comments directly at Let’s Talk Blacksburg: Climate Vulnerability.  There you will find a separate tab 
for each of the four policy teams: Food Resiliency & Security, Human Health & Wellbeing, Biodiversity & 
Ecosystems, and Infrastructure & Basic Services. 
 
You can also send questions or comments directly to the Sustainability Office: sustainability@blacksburg.gov
